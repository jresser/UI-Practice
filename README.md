# UI-Practice

This summer, I am creating at least one UI design from each weekday to practice my Frontend design skills. Some are modeled after designs from [UI Design Daily](uidesigndaily.com), and others are my own designs. 

Note: This was cut short due to getting a job, and may continue in the future.
